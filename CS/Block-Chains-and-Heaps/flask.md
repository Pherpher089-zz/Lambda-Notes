# Flask

flask.Flask() is the application object. It is used to instantiate an instance 
of the application that will act as a central registry for all of the 
rest of the flask application.

```python
class flask.Flask(import_name, static_url_path=None, static_folder='static', static_host=None, host_matching=False, subdomain_matching=False, template_folder='templates', instance_path=None, instance_relative_config=False, root_path=None)
```
