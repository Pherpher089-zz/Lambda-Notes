# Queues and Stacks

### Queue

A line of data. The first piece of data that goes in is the first to come out. FIFO

-   Queues are simple and intuitive to use and implement
-   Can be used to serialize data coming in from multiple sources
-   Not general purpose in and of them selves

Queues and stacks are very handy data structures with a myriad of uses, some of which we’ll see in a later lesson. The can be built using arrays or linked lists, but a linked list is more efficient. We’ll examine why this is the case.

## Stacks
Stack are first in, last out data structure. Things go in an order and must be removed in a reverse order.
