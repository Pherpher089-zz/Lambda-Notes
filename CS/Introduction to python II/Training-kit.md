## Polya's Problem Solving Techniques

### Steps

1. Understand the problem
   - asking questions
   - researching
2. Devise a plan
   - what is my approach?
   - Brake up into subtasks
3. Implement the plan
   - write that code
4. Reflect
   - How that worked out

When posed with an aspect of the problem that is subjective, ask questions. Make that aspect objective if at all possible.
