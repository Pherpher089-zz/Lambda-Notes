# Bios

## Lambda Dashboard Bio:

I was previously a game developer. I have a lot of project experience as a game developer including attempting indy startup with other students. I studied games at Moorpark College but never completed my degree. As I was planning to complete my education, I bumped into Lambda School and I signed up immediately. As a web developer, I have strong front end skills and while I did very well with node and my skills are sharp, I have less project experience on the back end. I am very good at 3D game programming and understand 3D math very well. Lambda has enhanced my CS skills to an amazing degree

## Git Hub Bio

Hybrid Game Programmer/Full Stack Web Developer. My satisfaction comes from making things work with my Skills in Unity/C# and the W3 Stack.

## Game Dev Portfolio Bio

Lead Programmer, Verludo Games.

Well rounded game developer with a primary focus in gameplay programming and game program architecture.

The majority of my programming experience is in Unity and C# though I can also write in C++, Javascript, and Python and am familiar with OOP and common game programming patterns. My preference is to work in 3D so I have built strong 3D math skills but my true love is creating characters, their controllers the cameras that follow them.

It is worth noting that I am also a 3D artist with the ability to UV, Texture and Material, Rig, and Animate. I worked on these skills early on before I decided programming was what I wanted to specialize in.

I am a part-time student at Moorpark College working my AA in Game Design and then BS in computer science. I plan on taking school slow due to expense as well as granting more time to build my production skills in game development.
