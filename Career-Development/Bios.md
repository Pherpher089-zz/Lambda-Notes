# Bios

## Lambda Dashboard Bio:

I was previously a game developer. I have a lot of project experience as a game developer including attempting indy startup with other students. I studied games at Moorpark College but never completed my degree. As I was planning to complete my education, I bumped into Lambda School and I signed up immediately. As a web developer, I have strong front end skills and while I did very well with node and my skills are sharp, I have less project experience on the back end. I am very good at 3D game programming and understand 3D math very well. Lambda has enhanced my CS skills to an amazing degree
