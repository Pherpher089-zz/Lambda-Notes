# Plan for getting a Tech job in 3 months

My goal is to get a job in the Bay Area as a Web Developer before my lease is up on September 30, 2020.

-   That is, as of today, June 29, 2020, 93 days to accomplish this goal.

## Why?

---

There is such a tight deadline because I would like to get a job in the industry while I am close. There is a chance that I will have to choose between moving to Modesto CA when my lease ends. If I have a job in the area before that time, I wont have to make the choice. This also serves as a tight deadline to push my limits as a developer and as a person.

I want to be a web developer because I want to be successful financially and in turn, provide a high quality of life for my self and my family. I also want to improve my technological skills drastically. I want to be an incredible programmer. Have a strong passion for the work that I do and the skills will surely benefit me as an entrepreneur. A strong career in tech will give me the platform to become so much more than I can imagine at this point in my life.

## How?

---

> In order for me to get a job as a web developer in the next 90 days, I will need to drastically improve my product while generating interviews at a very fast pace.

### How to generate as many interviews as possible

#### Apply to 10 positions a day

In order to generate more interviews there must be more applications. I will apply to 10 different positions every day to insure maximum exposure.

These applications need to be quality and the biggest way to do that is improve the Cover Letters. This can be done by spending `20 mins` prior to applying, `researching and refining your cover letter template`.

#### Network on LinkedIn

This requires being present on linked in. This can be done by opening `LinkedIn instead of FaceBook`.

Another strategy that may help is `posting Hacker Rank submissions with a question` for your following. This could generate good conversation with peers and show enthusiasm for the right stuff.

`Researching how to network` as a web developer for a job. This could improve my network which is supper important.

### How to improve the product

#### 3h of code challenges a day

This is a must. This is how I will nail the technical interview. `I will drill code challenges 2 hours every day.` I need to understand these problems fundamentally in order to be an adequate developer. In order to make this worth my while, I need to use the following strategy:

1. Solve the problem to the best of my abilities
2. If I can not solve it perfectly, research solutions and techniques for solving.
3. If I am able to solve it, still review descriptions.
4. Keep a file of solutions to problems and write a paragraph on the problem and how I solved it.
5. Return to questions after they have been solved to engrain solutions
6. Study similar problems

This will be the most effective way to sharpen my Computer Science fundamentals. This will prepare me for the interview process.

#### Building more sites

In order to make my product more valuable, I must produce more sites using the skills I have. I need to develop new sites quickly. This will take a large amount of time up front. The process will eventually get quicker. I will spend `3 hours every day working on my next site`.

I want to add 3 sites to my portfolio in this meantime.

-   Sticky Shop website
-   Jacob Tatman Portfolio
-   Back end for portfolio site
-   Front end for bucket list app

I need to develop a personal development cycle. This would be a step by step planning process that will alow me to make sites or other software with efficiency.

#### Improve Portfolio

In order for my product to stand out, I have to have a stunning and functional portfolio site. This means:

-   adding the pages its missing
-   adding a back end so that adding to my site is automated
-   improving the asthenic
-   adding a page with more information about me
-   adding projects to my portfolio
-   adding communication functionality

The better my portfolio looks, the better I look. In order to improve my portfolio, I will continue to work on it for `an hour every day`.

#### Continue to contribute on GitHub

I need to make a `contribution on GitHub every day` My graph should never be white. If that means taking my pc with me, so be it.
