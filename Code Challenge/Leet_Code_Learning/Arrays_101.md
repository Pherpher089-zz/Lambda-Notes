# Arrays 101

## A Array - A DVD box?

What is an array?

> An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.

On a computer, arrays can hold up to `N` items where `N` is chosen by the programmer.

Here is the code for creating an array to hold 15 DVDs in `Java`.

```Java
DVD[] dvdCollection = new DVD[15];

public class DVD {
    public string name;
    public int releaseYear;
    public string director;

    public DVD (String name, int releaseYear, String director) {
        this.name = name;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.director = director;
    }

    public String toString() {
        System.out.println(
            this.name + ", directed by " + this.director + ", released in " + this.releaseYear));
    }
}
```

Each place in our storage box has an identification number in the range of `0` to `N - 1`. `0` being the first. These numbers are called `indices`.

Lets put Avengers in the 7th index spot

```Java
DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("Avengers", 2012, "Joss Wendon");

dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;

```

Let's add a few more

```Java
DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");

// Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

// Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

// Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;
```

`Java` always initializes data in an array to `null` if the data typ is an object. If it is a primitive data type it is initialized with 0, 0.0, or false.
