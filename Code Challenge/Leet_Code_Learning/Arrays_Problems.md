# Max Consecutive Ones

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

    Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
        The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

```Java
//Java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int highestCount = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == 1) {
                count++;
            } else {
                if(count > highestCount){
                    highestCount = count;
                }
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return highestCount;
    }
}
```

```Java
//Java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int highestCount = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            if(count > highestCount){
                    highestCount = count;
            }
            if(nums[i] != 1) {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return highestCount;
    }
}
```

The issue was with the conditions. Before, `highestCount` had no chance to be assigned unless `nums[i] != 1`. This needed to happen no matter what. Also, `count` could only be reset when `nums[i] == 0` and highestCount was being reassigned.

# Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

### Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

### Example:

    Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits).
    345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits).
    2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
    6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
    7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits).
    Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.

### Constraints

-   1 <= nums.length <= 500
-   1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
