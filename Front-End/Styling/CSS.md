# CSS

## Mics. Properties
**box-sizing** - This property causes the padding and boarder to be included in the total width of the element.

By default the elements size is calculated as such:

width + padding + border 
heigth + padding + border

This causes elements to appear bigger than was spesified in the css. Assigning the property `border-box` will cause the elements to include the padding and the border to be included in the width and height.

*`border-box` is the only option for this property*
