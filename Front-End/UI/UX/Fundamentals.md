What is UI design?

-   Digital medium that the user interacts with.

UI vs UX?

-   UI is the visual elements of the design
-   UX the experience as a whole

> "UX is focused on the user's journey to solve a problem, is focused on how a products surfaces look and function"

UI Design vs Front End developer?

-   UI designs the views and front end developer will create those views via W3 stack

## Design Fundamentals

-   Color and Contrast
-   White space
-   Visual Hierarchy
-   Complexity vs Simplicity
-   Consistency
-   Scale

### Color and Contrast

Be carful of how colors compete with them selves. Starker contrasts make things more visible. Text needs to be on a contrasting back ground in order for users to be able to red it.

### White space

This is the negative space within your elements. The distance between the edge of the element and the beginning of the text. The alignment, the margin and padding ect.

### Visual Hierarchy

This determines the order in which the users eyes scan the element. The elements must compete for priority using things like type properties, size, position, color, etc...

### Simplicity vs Complexity

The rule of thumb is always to keep it simple stupid. Complexity does have it's place but takes skill to implement it correctly. Streamline and simple will always work well.

### Consistency

Things like consistent fonts, text sizes, alignment. Things that are not consistent are not pleasurable to view.

### Design Example Notes

-   It's definitely better not to try to reinvent the wheel. Keep your nav-bar at the top. Users expect this.
-   Understand the Grid. There is a show grid feature on the Adobe design software that shows the grid. I know this is valuable though I don't understand it fully.
-   Nav bar buttons can look good without caps. That is another element of contrast and visual hierarchy.
-   `The Fold` the area below the viewport
