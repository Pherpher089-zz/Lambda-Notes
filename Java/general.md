# Type Casting in Java

_W3 Schools_

There are two types of casting in Java. Widening Casting and Narrowing Casting.

-   Widening(automatic) - converting a smaller type to a bigger size.
    `byte` -> `short` -> `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`
-   Narrowing(manually) - converting a bigger type to a smaller size.
    `double` -> `float` -> `long` -> `int` -> `char` -> `short` -> `byte`
