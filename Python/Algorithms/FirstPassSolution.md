# First Pass Solutions

### Training Kit
Algorithmic problems are everywhere, in literally every domain of computer science / software development. Students need to get comfortable solving these sorts of problems, both for technical interviews, as well as for handling the day-to-day workload that is expected of software developers.

In this module, students are going to be learning about how to approach and tackle algorithmic problems. This sprint will introduce students to a few useful paradigms that can be used to approach and improve algorithm problems.
