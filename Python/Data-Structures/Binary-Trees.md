# Binary Trees
### finding the middle of a linked list without the length of the list
using two pointers to move through the list. One that moves one node at a time and one that moves two nodes at a time. Once the faster pointer reaches the end, the slower node will be in the middle.

## Graph
consists of a finite set of verticies and edges that connect the verticies

They may or may not change or go in both directions

they may have weight and may be mutable

### Trees  
- graph were each vertex has one parent
- all parts are connected
#### Binary trees 
- every vertex has 0 - 2 children
- values are greater to or equal to the value stored in the left node
- Values less than the root node must be stored in the right most sub tree
