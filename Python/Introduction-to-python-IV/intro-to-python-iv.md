## Object Oriented Programming

Inheritance relationships can be defined between classes in situations where more specific child classes extend the functionality of more general parent classes. These hierarchies help us write well-organized code and can allow for code re-use.

Overview
Perhaps the most important concept in OOP, a class may inherit from another class. This gives the child class all of the variables and methods found in the parent class, or classes, automatically. Child classes can also override parent methods to define alternate or additional behaviors. Inheritance is also sometimes described as an “is-a” relationship.

## Association

There are many examples of objects or constructs that exist in the real-world and are related to each other that do not have hierarchical, inheritance relationships. We need another way to describe relationships that are more accurately described as “has-a” relationships. In object-oriented design, these relationships are known as associations.

## OOP

#### Getters and setters

Getter funcions return private fields from a class. Setters will modify that data. Thes methods are used to keep people from modifying the origonal class fields but in a controlled environment.

#### Composition and Agrigation

need to figure out the dif.
I think composition is described in the training kit
